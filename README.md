# ðŸŒ³ Slime Bot V1 Archive

This is an archived version of `ðŸŒ³ Slime Bot` that I made a while ago. This repository is simply for the purpose of archiving the code for history.

## ðŸš« Warning

This version of `ðŸŒ³ Slime Bot` contains _many_ bugs and issues. If you are planning on using it for some reason, expect things to break. The code itself is also very bad, as I didn't have much experience when I started coding it. (Don't judge, I swear I am better now)

This version also has many unfinished features.

There is a [better version of `ðŸŒ³ Slime Bot`](https://github.com/Slqmy/Slime-Bot) now, which doesn't have so many bugs, and the code is much better. That version is maintained and actually used by me.

Again, this repository is purely for **historical purposes**.
